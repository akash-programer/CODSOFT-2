# ATM MACHINE
* **Project Overview**:The ATM Machine project, developed using Java and NetBeans IDE 20, is a comprehensive console-based application that replicates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project is designed to offer users a simulated banking experience, allowing them to perform fundamental operations such as withdrawing funds, depositing funds, and checking their account balances. Employing object-oriented principles and leveraging the features of NetBeans IDE 20, this project provides a well-structured and interactive solution for users to engage with basic financial transactions.
* **Key Features**:
* **BankAccount Class**:The core of the project, the BankAccount class, represents the user's bank account and encapsulates the account balance.
It includes methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of financial transactions.
* **ATM Class**:The ATM class acts as the interface between the user and the bank account, managing user interactions and transactions.
It presents users with a menu-driven interface, offering options to withdraw funds, deposit funds, check the account balance, and exit the ATM.
The class implements robust methods for handling user input, validating transactions, and providing meaningful feedback.
* **User Interaction**:Utilizing the Scanner class, the project ensures a dynamic and user-friendly interaction with the console.
Users navigate through a menu-driven interface, entering numerical choices (1-4) to execute desired banking operations.
* **Input Validation**:The project incorporates thorough input validation to guarantee that user inputs adhere to acceptable limits.
During deposit and withdrawal operations, the system verifies that input amounts are positive and that sufficient balances are available for withdrawals.
* **NetBeans IDE 20** Developed within the NetBeans IDE 20, the project benefits from a feature-rich and intuitive development environment.
NetBeans simplifies Java development with its integrated tools, code completion, and debugging features, enhancing the overall development experience.
* **Run Application**:Users can initiate the application seamlessly within the NetBeans IDE by opening the project and executing the main class (Main.java).
The console-based interface guides users through a straightforward banking experience.
* **Banking Operations**:
Users perform banking operations by entering corresponding numbers (1-4) for their desired transactions.
The ATM promptly provides feedback on the outcome of transactions and displays the updated account balance.
* **Exiting the ATM**:
Exiting the ATM is user-friendly, with users able to choose the exit option (4) at any point during their interaction.
